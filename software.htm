    <p>Milorad is currently developing four (five-ish) softwares; MICA (-GM and -RS), Dum Dum Fait, SupaTaxKard, and MAIA.</p>
    <h1>MICA-GM (Milorad Image Creation Application in GameMaker)</h1>
    <p>MICA is Milorad's art program, written in GameMaker. Development is almost complete - there will be one more patch before development is entirely stopped to work on other projects.<br/><a href="https://github.com/milorad-co/mica">MICA Github page</a></p>
    <p>Current development progress: Complete<br>Current development focus: Low</p>
    <h1>MICA-RS (Milorad Image Creation Application in Rust)</h1>
    <p>Since rust is a much faster programming language, and GameMaker isn't exactly suited for work on art programs, we have decided to begin work on a new version of MICA, which will be much faster and written in Rust!</p>
    <p>Current development progress: ~5%<br>Current development focus: Low</p>
    <h1>Dum Dum Fait</h1>
    <p>A card game adapted into video game form. Won't be made in a long time.</p>
    <p>Current development progress: 0%, only a concept<br>Current development focus: None</p>
    <h1>SupaTaxKard</h1>
    <p>A mod for SuperTuxKart. Almost complete.</p>
    <p>Current development progress: ~90%<br>Current development focus: Low</p>
    <h1>MAIA (Milorad Automated Installation Application)</h1>
    <p>MI is a commandline installation application which can install files from the latest release of a GitHub repository.</p>
    <p>Current development progress: ~75%<br>Current development focus: Very High</p>
