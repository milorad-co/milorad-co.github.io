    <br/>1) Peteland is ruled by two Leaders. When one Leader proposes to create, modify, or change a law, if the other agrees, the law is passed immediately. If they do not agree, a vote is held in which the people decide whether the law should be passed.
    <br/>2) Below the Leaders in rank is the Leader of Air and Naval Forces and the Leader of Police, Fire, and Ambulance. The Leaders choose who takes these roles (a vote is held if they cannot agree), but whoever takes these roles must be willing to take them.
    <br/>3) Every four years a vote is held to decide who the new Leaders are. Anyone who already has a governmental role* is allowed to run. The two highest voted candidates become Leader.
    <br/>4) No one aged 70 or older may vote for anything mentioned in the above text, or have any governmental role*.
    <br/>5) If a Leader dies or steps down for any reason, an immediate vote, similar to the vote described in 3a except there is only one winner, is held to determine the replacement Leader.
